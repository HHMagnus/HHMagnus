### Greetings traveler!

I'm Magnus, a Software Engineer interested in Software Architecture, Modelling and Coding. You can make me talk endlessly by discussing technical tradeoff, architectural dilemmaes or coding challenges.

Currently, I am working as a Consultant at Netcompany, where I am part of the Core Team for developing a Grant Management Platform.

I studied a MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where I focused on Embedded and Distributed Systems.

In my freetime you will find me working on small Software projects.
