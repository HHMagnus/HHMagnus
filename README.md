### Greetings traveler!

I'm Magnus, a Senior Software Architect/Engineer interested in coding and anything software related. You can make me talk endlessly by discussing technical tradeoff, architectural dilemmaes or coding challenges.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Architect at Netcompany, where I work on different projects to deliver software to our customers.

I studied a MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where I focused on Embedded and Distributed Systems.

In my freetime you will find me working on different projects, some of which you can see below.
