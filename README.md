### Greetings, traveler!

I'm Magnus, a Software Engineer with a deep passion for coding and software development. I love discussing technical trade-offs, architectural dilemmas, and coding challenges.

Currently, I work as a Senior Architect at Netcompany, leading various projects to deliver high-quality software solutions to our clients.

I earned an MSc in Computer Science and Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), with a focus on distributed systems.

In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, some of which you can explore below.
